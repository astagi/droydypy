Droydypy depends on:
- python (just for bootstrapping)
- android ndk
- Android Debug Bridge (adb)

Build and try Droydypy following these steps:

1. Configure file setup_cfg.py (I've left my setting as an example)

2. Make these commands to build and install:

    $ python setup.py build
    $ python setup.py devices (if you want to know what devices are attached)
    $ python setup.py install your_device_serial dest_path

3. Now you can try Tinypy on your device:

    $ python setup.py shell your_device_serial
    $ # cd dest_path
    $ # ./tinypy hello.py
